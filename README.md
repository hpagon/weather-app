### Description

This is a simple weather application made with the purpose of using the fetch API, promises and the async/await syntax.

The application is pretty simple; enter any city or location you would like or select from any one of the drop down results. Metric and Imperial unit conversions are provided for accesibility. A refresh button is also present in case you want to see the latest weather data.
